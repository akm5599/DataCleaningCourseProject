# Background

This data was generated from an experiment of 30 subjects, all of whom wore a Samsung smartphone on the waist while performing a variety of activities. These activities include walking, walking upstairs, walking downstairs, sitting, standing and laying.

The initial data was split into 70% for training use and 30% for testing use. The measured variables, activity labels, variable names and subject variable column were all separate files initially. Initially this data was in untidy format, but through analysis a tidy dataset was created for all data collected.

An analysis was also performed to create a separate independent tidy data set that calculates the mean for all mean and standard deviation measurements, summarizing by the Subject and the Activity being performed.


# Files:

- "TIDYdataset.txt": A tidy dataset that summarizes all 
   of    the mean and standard deviation measurements by 
   their      mean, grouping by the Subject and Activity

- "run_analysis.R": The R file in which the data 
   cleaning     and analysis was performed

- "CodeBook.md": The markdown file in which the data  
   cleaning process is explained and the data and its 
   variables are defined. It also contains other 
   important    information.

- "README.md": The markdown file that provides the     
   necessary information to understand the analysis 
   performed
